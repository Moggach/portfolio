<h3>What I’ve been working on</h3>
<p>I’ve been wrapping up my work on the new <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/">Common Knowledge website</a> with tasks like integrating <a href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog</a> for product analytics, switching the domain over from the staging site to production and fixing some bugs that came out of the QA process. I also set up a <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock</a> sandbox site to test integrating an existing multisite WordPress installation with a modern CI/CD process and version control.</p>

<li>use <a href="https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot">Tocbot</a> to build a table of contents from headings in an HTML document</li>
