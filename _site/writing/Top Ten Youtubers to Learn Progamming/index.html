<p>We’re all going to be stuck indoors for a while this winter and in need of new ways to pass the time. The appetite for learning to code in publishing has never been higher but many people don’t know where to start.</p>
<p>As an avid consumer of YouTube programming tutorials I can recommend it as a way to learn. I’ve used YouTube to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I’ve been introduced to new libraries and frameworks and gotten project ideas.</p>
