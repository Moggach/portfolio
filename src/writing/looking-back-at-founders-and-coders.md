excerpt: "This blog is a follow up to
My Journey to Becoming a Developer.

In that post I described how Iâ€™d come to apply to the Founders and Coders bootcamp and make the switch to a new career.

Now as I start my first job in the tech industry Iâ€™m reflecting on my experiences on the course and my hopes for the future."

  <p>In that post, I described how Iâ€™d come to apply to the Founders and Coders boot camp and make the switch to a new career.</p>

  <h2>What did I learn in the past 12 weeks at FAC?</h2>

  <p>Most obviously I learned a lot about web development. The FAC curriculum teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, Next.js, and React. I learned how to build a web application from scratch, which culminated in our final <a href="https://github.com/tech-for-better/solent-mind" target="_blank">Tech for Better</a> projects with real-life stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Beyond the technical skills, I feel like I got a crash course in learning to work as a team. The way the FAC course is structured means that you are constantly learning from and teaching each other - alongside guidance from mentors from previous cohorts. There is an emphasis at FAC on leaving nobody behind, which makes it a very supportive environment in which to learn.</p>

  <p>I also improved my persistence and problem-solving, which I think are crucial skills for all developers. Learning how to learn - and Google things where you are unsure - is the only way to keep up with the ever-changing technologies and frameworks in the industry.</p>

  <h2>What were the challenges?</h2>

  <p>As it was a boot camp, it was very intense and in the first half of the course, we were learning a big new topic every week. I often felt like I was only grasping the fundamentals of the previous week by the middle of the next. I had, and still do have, a persistent feeling like I donâ€™t know enough. I also struggled with the feeling of frustration that you get from tricky bugs (read <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/the-origin-of-the-term-computer-bug" target="_blank">here</a> for why computer problems are called bugs ðŸ¦Ÿ).</p>

  <h2>Whatâ€™s next?</h2>

  <p>I've started an apprenticeship as a software developer at <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/" target="_blank">Common Knowledge</a>, which Iâ€™m really excited about. Iâ€™ll also be back at FAC for a week in January to help mentor the next cohort. In the longer term, Iâ€™d like to play an active role in the FAC community by helping out beginners as well as learning from my peers.</p>

  <p>If you are looking to change careers into software development I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/" target="_blank">Founders and Coders</a>.
