<p>Receiving my apprenticeship result 👩‍🎓 Building a new website for campaign group Swarm 🐝 Adding new features to The World Transformed site 🏭 Support work for membership organization The Left Book Club 📕</p>

<h2> What I’ve been working on </h2>

<p>I received my <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/2">apprenticeship</a> final grade in April and I’m very proud to say that I passed with a Merit. I’ve signed a further contract with my apprenticeship employer <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/">Common Knowledge</a> so I’m now a Junior Engineer and looking forward to learning more with them over the next year.
Aside from that, I’ve been adding features to <a href="https://theworldtransformed.org/">The World Transformed</a> site in preparation for this year’s festival and doing some bug fixes for <a href="https://leftbookclub.com/">The Left Book Club</a> - specifically to do with their Shopify integration.</p>

<h2> What I’ve been learning </h2>

<p>This month I’ve been learning how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a <code>.nvmrc</code> file to repositories to specify which Node version should be used with a project</li>
  <li>Use the <code>linearGradient</code> element to recreate a Photoshop gradient map with an SVG</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://wagtailmenus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Wagtail Menus</a> package to create different editable menus and custom menu templates for a site</li>
  <li>Set up an SSH connection to a WordPress installation hosted on Kinsta and use git to clone a repo into it</li>
  <li>Set up a Cron Job to run the Django command <code>publish_scheduled_pages</code> every half hour</li>
</ul>

<h2> What’s next </h2>

<p>In May I’ll be finishing the SWARM website build. I will also be working on the new site for indigenous communications network Awasqa. I’m assisting a colleague with a WordPress site for The Architecture Lobby and I will likely be doing some additional devops support work for 350.org. I want to dedicate some personal time to creating a new personal site with a portfolio and migrating this blog. I haven’t decided yet which language or framework to use but I’m considering something like React and <a href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity.io</a>.</p>

<h2> Interesting links </h2>

<p>These are some interesting links that I’ve come across this month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trigger GitHub Actions and view status and logs directly from the editor with this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.vscode-github-actions">VSCode extension</a></li>
  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions">collection of JavaScript interview questions and answers</a> that are helpful for preparing for job interviews</li>
  <li>This <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/01/level-up-css-skills-has-selector">Smashing Magazine article</a> explains how the <code>:has()</code> selector could soon become a game-changer</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.webperf.tips/">comprehensive collection of techniques developers can use to optimize their web apps</a> from Stripe engineer Joe Liccini</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5eXZwvvxt3K2dxha3BSaAe">NerdOut@Spotify podcast</a> produced by the Spotify engineering team gives an insider look into their work</li>
</ul>
