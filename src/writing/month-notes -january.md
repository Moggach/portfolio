  <h2>What I‚Äôve been working on</h2>

  <p>This month has been dedicated to my final project for my apprenticeship - a rebuild of the <a href="https://alpha.commonknowledge.coop/" target="_blank">Common Knowledge website</a>. Working from designs created in Figma (by our co-op designer Gemma) I have created a CMS in the Django based framework Wagtail. I have also built custom HTML templates and a CSS theme with Tailwind. I‚Äôve written notes from each week of the project summarizing my main learnings which can be viewed <a href="https://alpha.commonknowledge.coop/writing/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>What I‚Äôve been learning</h2>

  <p>This month I've been learning how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>build custom Page models and StreamField blocks with Django and Wagtail</li>
    <li>write database queries with the Django ORM</li>
    <li>write end-to-end tests with Cypress and unit tests with Pytest</li>
    <li>use the Stimulus JavaScript framework with Django</li>
    <li>use the Flowbite library for UI components</li>
    <li>set up a staging site on Fly.io</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What‚Äôs next</h2>

  <p>In February I‚Äôll be moving onto other project work with Common Knowledge. I‚Äôll also be attending two interviews with the apprenticeship assessors.</p>
