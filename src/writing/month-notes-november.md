<h2> What I‚Äôve been working on </h2>

<p>This month has been full of a few different projects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôve started to build a new personal website in WordPress</li>
  <li>I picked up some supporting work for the <a href="https://futurenatures.org/">FutureNatures</a> website debugging some issues with a search and filter plugin</li>
  <li>Added the option for embedding <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">Shiny apps</a> into pages on the <a href="https://www.stop-watch.org/">StopWatch</a> site</li>
  <li>Common Knowledge is also working on a big redesign of the <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap</a> website, and I‚Äôve been helping there with some UI components like a carousel slide and a newsletter sign up</li>
  <li>With our Project Manager I‚Äôve been planning and scoping the new Common Knowledge website - details below</li>
  <li>I took part in mock interviews with Founders and Coders to prepare for my assessed portfolio review in the near future</li>
</ul>

<h2> What I‚Äôve been learning </h2>

<p>Over the past month I‚Äôve learnt how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use <a href="https://flowbite.com/">Flowbite</a> to build UI components with Tailwind CSS in Django templates</li>
  <li>use <code>meta_query</code> inside <code>WP_Query</code> to order and filter by custom meta fields</li>
  <li>use the <a href="https://stimulus-carousel.stimulus-components.com/">Stimulus Carousel</a> package (built on top of Swiper.js) to create a responsive carousel component. One really cool thing about this is the customisable SwiperOptions. In this case, I used them to determine the number of slides displayed based on screen size</li>
  <li>create a custom EmbedFinder class in a Django application</li>
</ul>

<h2> What‚Äôs next </h2>

<p>In December I‚Äôll be working exclusively on my final project which will be a redesign and rebuild of the Common Knowledge website. This project and its documentation will form the second half of my grade for my apprenticeship. I‚Äôll be the primary developer on this project which involves migrating the current Gatsby site with content in Markdown to the Django Wagtail CMS.
I‚Äôll be aiming to make a maintainable, performant and accessible website that will serve the business needs of Common Knowledge.</p>

<h2> Interesting links </h2>

<p>These are some interesting links that I‚Äôve come across this month.</p>
