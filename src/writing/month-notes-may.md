<h2> What I’ve been working on</h2>

<p>This month I’ve been helping get <a href="https://theworldtransformed.org/">The World Transformed</a> website ready for the launch of their 2023 festival. This included some site enhancements like allowing editors to customise background and text colours of streamfield blocks and adding a video player to the full width header image. I have continued supporting <a href="https://350.org/">350.org</a> with their transition over to the <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock pattern</a> for their WordPress sites. This month we successfully recreated and deployed a production 350 site with this new stack. Finally, I’ve been adapting the <a href="https://schematictheme.com/">Schematic WordPress theme</a> so that it can be reused for the SWARM website redesign.</p>

<h2> What I’ve been learning</h2>

<p>This month I’ve been learning how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programmatically fetch raw Shopify data using the <a href="https://wpshop.io/">ShopWP</a> plugin and display it in a custom WordPress Gutenberg block</li>
  <li>Use the poster attribute in the <code>video</code> element to display an image until the video content is ready to be played</li>
  <li>Retrieve data from a WordPress post field based on the post ID with the <code>get_post_field()</code> function</li>
  <li>Create section layouts in JSON for a custom WordPress theme</li>
  <li>Add a color picker to the admin interface in a Django Wagtail project with the <a href="https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-colorfield">django-colorfield</a> package</li>
</ul>

<h2> What’s next</h2>

<p>In June I’ll be finishing my work on SWARM and preparing the site for launch. I am expecting to start a new project building a new site for indigenous communications network Awasqa. I’m taking a break towards the end of the month to work on personal projects including a new portfolio site that I hope to be porting this blog to soon.</p>
