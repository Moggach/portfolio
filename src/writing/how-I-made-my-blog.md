<h1> How I made my blog </h1>

<p>When I decided to start blogging, I knew that I wanted to build the site myself. I chose to use the Gatsby framework as I had been learning JavaScript for a while and I already had a project built in React. Gatsby is an open source framework that helps you create a static website easily and quickly. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs" target="_blank">The Gatsby docs</a> have a tutorial that can get you started with a blog site within minutes. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/" target="_blank">The Gatsby Starters Library</a> has templates for e-commerce, portfolio, blog, and other sites.</p>

<p>To make the site, I followed this <a href="https://youtu.be/8t0vNu2fCCM" target="_blank">YouTube tutorial</a> closely. The creator, Andrew Mead, has more courses on the JavaScript ecosystem on his <a href="https://mead.io/" target="_blank">blog</a>. I also had a lot of fun with the whole open source ecosystem around Gatsby, including the many plugins.</p>

<h2> Challenges ‚õ∞Ô∏è </h2>

<p>There were many things I found difficult about the project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I struggled with the conceptual difference between components and pages. This meant I had code on my pages that should have been in components.</li>
  <li>I used CSS modules, but there were still too many styles in the global scope. Remembering to write classNames in the JSX way was another headache.</li>
  <li>Basically anything that didn‚Äôt follow the tutorial exactly. This taught me a lesson about understanding the code (and not simply copying it) before I tried to build on or debug it.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Things I like ‚ù§Ô∏è </h2>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm still pleased with how the site looks and performs. I like the minimal design, and Gatsby‚Äôs speed makes browsing pleasingly snappy.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs easy to add posts, and markdown is a distraction-free and intuitive writing experience.</li>
  <li>It works well with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, which is a super-efficient and easy-to-use hosting platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Things I want to add üöß </h2>

<p>There are, of course, things I want to add to or improve about the site.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security vulnerabilities are the most urgent. One drawback of the framework is that it has a bunch of dependencies that have to be maintained and, in some cases, replaced.</li>
  <li>I would like to create a reusable sidebar component to abstract some of the site‚Äôs duplicated code.</li>
  <li>It would be great to have pagination on the blog index page and set a maximum number of listings per page.</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoyed developing with Gatsby, and I would make another site with the framework. I hope that I‚Äôll have enough time soon to make the improvements I listed above. If you have any questions about the process, let me know on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaTherseCu" target="_blank">@MollyBloom1989</a></p>

<p>Good luck with your projects!</p>
