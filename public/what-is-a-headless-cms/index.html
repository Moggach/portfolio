<h1> What is a CMS? </h1>
<p>A CMS or content management system is an application that helps users create, manage and modify content on a website.<br>
Most CMS are designed to be easy to use without knowing how to code. They typically have design templates to choose from and offer extensions and add-ons. A good CMS platform will allow you to easily import and export your content.<br>
Some commonly used CMS are WordPress, Django, Drupal, Wix and Joomla.</p>

<h2> Headless CMS vs Traditional CMS </h2>
<p>A traditional CMS has two layers:<br>
A presentation layer which determines how your content is displayed in the browser<br>
A database where the content is structured and stored.</p>
<p>This type of tightly connected structure is called “coupled” and it makes structural changes almost impossible without knowing HTML and CSS. The presentation layer<br>
A Headless CMS separates the presentation layer (known as the “Head”) from the database with communication between the two happening via an API (application programming interface).</p>
<h2> Headless API </h2>
<p>Some traditional CMS platforms such as WordPress have developed their own API which allows users to apply a different language or framework on the frontend. This means that you get the best of this free and powerful CMS without being tied to its standard way of presenting content.<br>
WordPress has also adopted the Gutenberg editor which is written in a popular frontend framework called React.</p>
<h2> Content infrastructure </h2>
<p>Content infrastructure is a type of headless CMS but instead of arranging content around website pages it creates a content model. This model will break down the content into its component parts such as a newsletter sign-up, a headline or article copy. It will be collected into a centralized hub that can have different outputs such as a website, an app or internal collaboration and communication tools.</p>
<h2> Why use a Headless CMS? </h2>
<p>There are many advantages to using a Headless CMS including flexibility, scalability and enhanced security as the presentation layer is not connected to the database. This approach can be seen as the best of both worlds: allowing you to make the most of mature platforms like WordPress and Django with flashier options on the frontend.<br>
There are even further benefits to content infrastructure which reduces content duplication and makes collaboration easier.</p>
