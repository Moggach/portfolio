<h3>What I’ve been working on</h3>
<p>I received my <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/2">apprenticeship</a> final grade in April and I’m very proud to say that I passed with a Merit. I’ve signed a further contract with my apprenticeship employer <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/">Common Knowledge</a> so I’m now a Junior Engineer and looking forward to learning more with them over the next year.
Aside from that, I’ve been adding features to <a href="https://theworldtransformed.org/">The World Transformed</a> site in preparation for this year’s festival and doing some bug fixes for <a href="https://leftbookclub.com/">The Left Book Club</a> - specifically to do with their Shopify integration.</p>
<h3>What I’ve been learning</h3>
<p>This month I’ve been learning how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>add a <code>.nvmrc</code> file to repositories to specify which Node version should be used with a project</li>
<li>use the <code>linearGradient</code> element to recreate a Photoshop gradient map with an SVG</li>
<li>use the <a href="https://wagtailmenus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Wagtail Menus</a> package to create different editable menus and custom menu templates for a site</li>
<li>set up an SSH connection to a WordPress installation hosted on Kinsta and use git to clone a repo into it</li>
<li>set up a Cron Job to run the Django command <code>publish_scheduled_pages</code> every half hour</li>
</ul>
<h3>What’s next</h3>
<p>In May I’ll be finishing the SWARM website build. I will also be working on the new site for indigenous communications network Awasqa. I’m assisting a colleague with a WordPress site for The Architecture Lobby and I will likely be doing some additional devops support work for 350.org. I want to dedicate some personal time to creating a new personal site with a portfolio and migrating this blog. I haven’t decided yet which language or framework to use but I’m considering something like React and Sanity.io.</p>
