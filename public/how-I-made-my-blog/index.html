      <h2>How I made my blog</h2>
<p>When I decided to start blogging I knew that I wanted to build the site myself. I chose to use the Gatsby framework as I had been learning JavaScript for a while and I already had a project built in React.</p>
<p>Gatsby is an open source framework that helps you create a static website easily and quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs">The Gatsby docs</a> have a tutorial that can get you started with a blog site within minutes. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/">The Gatsby Starters Library</a> has templates for e-commerce, portfolio, blog and other sites.</p>
<p><img src="./Gatsby_site.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To make the site I followed this <a href="https://youtu.be/8t0vNu2fCCM">YouTube tutorial</a> closely. The creator, Andrew Mead, has more courses on the JavaScript ecosystem on his <a href="https://mead.io/">blog</a>. I also had a lot of fun with the whole open source ecosystem around Gatsby including the many plugins.</p>
<h3>Challenges ‚õ∞Ô∏è</h3>
<p>There were many things I found difficult about the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>I struggled with the conceptual difference between components and pages. This meant I had code on my pages that should have been in components.</li>
<li>I used CSS modules but there were still too many styles in the global scope. Remembering to write classNames in the JSX way was another headache.</li>
<li>Basically anything that didn‚Äôt follow the tutorial exactly‚Ä¶This taught me a lesson about understanding the code (and not simply copying it) before I tried to build on or debug it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things I like ‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm still pleased with how the site looks and performs. I like the minimal design and Gatsby‚Äôs speed makes browsing pleasingly snappy.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs easy to add posts and markdown is a distraction free and intuitive writing experience.</li>
<li>It works well with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> which is a super efficient and easy to use hosting platform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things I want to add üöß</h3>
<p>There are of course things I want to add to or improve about the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security vulnerabilities are the most urgent. One drawback of the framework is that it has a bunch of dependencies that have to be maintained and in some cases replaced.</li>
<li>I would like to create a reusable sidebar component to abstract some of the site‚Äôs duplicated code.</li>
<li>It would be great to have pagination on the blog index page and set a maximum number of listings per page.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoyed developing with Gatsby and I would make another site with the framework. I hope that I‚Äôll have enough time soon to make the improvements I listed above. If you have any questions about the process let me know on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyBloom1989">@MollyBloom1989</a></p>
<p>Good luck with your projects!</p>
