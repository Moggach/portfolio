I’ve worked in book publishing for eight years but I’ve loved it. I’ve [won awards](https://hub.londonbookfair.co.uk/trailblazer-awards-winners-revealed-by-the-london-book-fair-3/) (which is really nice and slightly embarrassing) and I’ve worked on some beautiful books.
<p>Now though I’m transitioning into becoming a software developer with <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders and Coders</a>. If you’re interested in my journey this is how I got here...</p>

<h2> Dabbled with coding </h2>
<p>I started dabbling with coding quite soon out of Uni and I even attended a course on Dreamweaver (when that was still widely used). I taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS which is what you needed at the time to make basic websites. I ventured into Javascript but found it quite scary without a maths or computing background. I kept coming back to it though mostly because I liked the elegance of coding. I realised it was all about finding the most efficient solution to a problem.</p>
<h2> Made learning a habit </h2>
<p>What really supercharged my interest in coding was when I made a commitment to practising it every day. Initially this was just a few minutes and I used the <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> app. I worked my way through the HTML and CSS tutorials on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 schools</a> and started reading <a href="https://javascript.info/">Javascript.info</a>. This was when I properly started to grapple with Javascript and I found that persistence and googling were enough to see me through. The developer community also has a great ethos of sharing knowledge and constant learning which really inspired me.</p>
<h2> Got involved with events and meetups </h2>
<p>Eventually I started to get brave enough to talk to other people about what I was doing. I was a coach at the <a href="https://dayofcode.co.uk/">2019 FutureBook Day of Code</a> which was a turning point for me in terms of trusting in my own abilities. I started attending (by then online) meetups at <a href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</a> and <a href="">Founders and Coders</a>. At these events I got free support and tuition but I also connected to a group of people who had, or were, transitioning their careers towards software development.</p>
<h2> Made projects </h2>
<p>I think it’s really important to put your new skills into practice as soon as you can. I started making websites - including the one that hosts this blog which I built following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM&amp;t=15148s">this tutorial</a>. I tried to combine my existing skills and experience in publishing with coding so I also made a <a href="https://romantic-ardinghelli-5883b1.netlify.app/">React application</a> that returns data from the Google Books API.<br>
I created a <a href="https://github.com/Moggach">GitHub profile</a> where I pushed my code and went through the whole process of building a site from <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a> to hosting on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p>
<h2> Joined FAC</h2>
<p>Earlier this year I made the huge decision to apply to the <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/">Founders and Coders bootcamp</a>. It was a lengthy application process and the requirements were tough. I knew though, that even if I wasn't successful, the learning I was gaining wouldn't be wasted. I am in the middle of the part time course now and it's already one of the best things I’ve ever done. In September I’ll be leaving my current job at Abrams &amp; Chronicle Books (which I’ve loved and has supported me to take this step) to study at FAC full time and become a junior developer.</p>
<p>I hope that this has been interesting to read and has given you some insight or inspiration to start your own journey with coding!
