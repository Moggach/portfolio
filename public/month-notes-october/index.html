      <h3>Notes from October</h3>
<p>In this post I‚Äôm experimenting with a different format for my blog. Month notes are a format where I can share what I‚Äôve been working on over the month and some of the things I‚Äôm learning.
I‚Äôm hoping it will be useful for me to look back on as a learning diary and also for anyone wondering what the day to day life of an apprentice developer is like.</p>

<h4>What I‚Äôve been working on</h4>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm finishing up my portfolio to submit for the apprenticeship assessment process. This will be a summary of all my work for my employer (Common Knowledge) so far. Read more about the software developer apprenticeship and how it‚Äôs delivered at Founders and Coders at https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apprenticeship</li>
<li>I‚Äôve started work on a redesigned WordPress website for Common Knowledge client The Architecture Lobby. We are still in the design phase of the project so I‚Äôve been working on establishing the infrastructure like the GitHub repo, getting the site running smoothly locally and setting up continuous integration</li>
</ul>
<h4>What I‚Äôve been learning</h4>
<p>Over the past month I‚Äôve learnt how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>install Bedrock (a modern WordPress boilerplate) and add seed content from an existing theme</li>
<li>use PhPMyAdmin and SQL to work with a WordPress database</li>
<li>create custom post types in WordPress</li>
<li>use the Carbon Fields plugin to create custom metadata fields on WordPress posts</li>
<li>display custom metadata in WordPress template files</li>
<li>use rsync to synchronize files between GitHub and a web host and how to automate this in a GitHub action for continuous integration</li>
</ul>
<h4>What‚Äôs next</h4>
<p>Soon I‚Äôll be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussing my portfolio with my apprenticeship assessor</li>
<li>Building out the The Architecture Lobby site based on Figma files from our co-op designer</li>
<li>Starting discovery work on a WordPress upgrade for a book publisher and whether we can use WooCommerce integrated with ONIX to replace their existing solution</li>
<li>Starting work on my final apprenticeship project - a redesign of the Common Knowledge website</li>
</ul>
<h4>Interesting links</h4>
<p>These are some interesting links that I‚Äôve come across this month.</p>
