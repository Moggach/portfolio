<h2>Attending Co-Tech conference at Space4</h2>

<span>09 Oct 2021</span>

<p>Co-Tech (Co-operative Technologists) is a network of co-operatives that sell digital or tech services. They met for their conference on 23-24th September in the co-working space at Space4 in Finsbury Park. I attended as a new member of Common Knowledge who have hired me as an apprentice software developer.</p>

<h2>My journey to becoming a developer</h2>
</a>

<span>09 Aug 2021</span>

<h2>Why you should make a personal website</h2>
</a>

<span>08 Jul 2021</span>

<p> A personal website can be thought of as like your ‘home’ on the internet. It is a way to make yourself stand out from the competition. It helps you control your online presence and build a personal brand. It also makes it easier for potential employers to find you.</p>
