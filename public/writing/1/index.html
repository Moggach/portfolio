<h2>Tips for reading code (for new developers)</h2>
</a>

<span>16 Sep 2022</span>

<p> One of the most important transitions new developers need to make is from working on their own projects to existing codebases within larger teams. Most often working as a developer involves extending and maintaining code that’s already been written.</p>

<span>17 Aug 2022</span>

<p> This blog was originally posted on the Common Knowledge website
I’m Anna and I’m a software engineering apprentice at Common Knowledge. I thought it might be interesting to write about my experiences as a software engineering apprentice since September 2021.</p>

<h2>What is a headless CMS?</h2>
</a>

<span>24 Jun 2022</span>

<p>A CMS or content management system is an application that helps users create, manage and modify content on a website. Most CMS are designed to be easy to use without knowing how to code. They typically have design templates to choose from and offer extensions and add-ons. A good CMS platform will allow you to easily import and export your content.</p>

<h2>Advice for learning how to code</h2>
</a>

<span>04 May 2022</span>

<p> When I was working in publishing I started learning to code by studying for 20 minutes each day. After about 18 months of doing this I did a bootcamp and got an apprenticeship in tech. This post gives some tips I have for anyone learning to code - especially alongside a full time job or other responsibilities. </p>

<h2>What is the WordPress Gutenberg editor?</h2>
</a>

<span>09 Apr 2022</span>

<p> WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world and the Gutenberg editor is its most significant change since 2003. It was introduced in Wordpress version 5.0 which came out in 2018 and it replaces the previous Tiny MCE editor with a block based drag and drop interface.</p>

<span>10 Mar 2022</span>

<p> I’ve been working as an apprentice software developer for a couple of months now and there are some things that I’ve learnt that I wanted to share. I hope that the below is useful to you if you are thinking about becoming developers or graduating from a bootcamp and going into your first job.</p>

<h2>How I made my blog</h2>

<span>19 Feb 2022</span>

<p> When I decided to start blogging I knew that I wanted to build the site myself. I chose to use the Gatsby framework as I had been learning JavaScript for a while and I already had a project built in React.</p>

<h2>Looking back at Founders and Coders</h2>

<span>01 Jan 2022</span>

<p>This blog is a follow up to My Journey to Becoming a Developer.
In that post I described how I’d come to apply to the Founders and Coders bootcamp and make the switch to a new career.
Now as I start my first job in the tech industry I’m reflecting on my experiences on the course and my hopes for the future.</p>
