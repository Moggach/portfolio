<p>For the final part of my Software Development Apprenticeship Iâ€™ve been working on a new website for <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/">Common Knowledge</a>. Common Knowledge makes digital tools to help social movements build power. They needed a new website that could be updated with a CMS and could better display the range of work that the co-op does.</p>
<p><img src="./CK-website.png" alt=""></p>
<h1> Website stack ðŸ¥ž </h1>
<h2> Wagtail CMS ðŸ¦œ </h2>
<p>I built the site with <a href="https://wagtail.org/">Wagtail</a> which is an open-source content management system (CMS) built on the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a>. I chose Wagtail for this project because it has a user friendly admin interface that makes it easy to add and update content. It is also fully customisable and extensible with a range of packages and plugins available and an active developer community. Wagtail also inherits Djangoâ€™s built in protection from common security vulnerabilities in web applications.</p>
<h2> Tailwind CSS ðŸ’… </h2>
<p>For CSS I used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> which helped speed up the development process as it gave me access to thousands of in-built utility classes that I could add directly into my HTML. I set up a Tailwind configuration file where I declared values for colours, a type scale, fonts and breakpoints. This helped me to quickly apply a consistent design and visual style to the site.</p>
<h2> Stimulus JS âš¡ </h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">Stimulus</a> which is a lightweight JavaScript framework to add small reusable snippets of JavaScript into the HTML templates I already had with Django. I avoided using a framework like React because it would add an unnecessary amount of files for what would be a relatively simple functionality.</p>
<h2> What went well âœ… </h2>
<p>These are some of the highlights from the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Wagtail meant that I could get a site set up with a full content management system and user authentication within minutes</li>
<li>Wagtail also allowed me to create custom mixed content blocks (known as Streamfields) that can be reused across the site.</li>
<li>Using Tailwind minimised the risk of conflicting styles in my CSS and made it easier to debug in the DevTools Inspector. I also didnâ€™t have to switch between HTML and CSS files while I was developing or think about how to name my CSS classes.</li>
<li>With the <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a> CLI I could create and launch an app on Fly from my terminal. This combined with a GitHub Action made deploying to the staging environment for the site really smooth.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Biggest challenges ðŸš¨ </h2>
<p>There were of course bugs and challenges throughout the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the things I struggled with the most was working with Django migration files. These files contain the SQL that Django needs to create, update or delete database tables. I occasionally found that the files conflicted with one another or that they had become out of sync with the state of my local database. To debug this I learnt a lot about SQL and how Django keeps track of migrations.</li>
<li>I used the <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">Turbo</a> for page transitions within the site but this also prevented the browser from loading any JavaScript that was not within a Stimulus controller without a full refresh. To fix this I recreated the JavaScript behaviour I wanted for the navbar from within a Stimulus controller ensuring it would work in conjunction with Turbo.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Future improvements ðŸ”® </h2>
<p>Although my full time work on this project has come to an end there are some improvements I would like to make in the future. One of these is to theme the CMS admin interface with the Common Knowledge brand colours. I would also like to add an option for the visitor to select a colour scheme that provides a higher contrast than the default. Lastly there are definitely performance improvements I can make by replacing jpeg images with WebP formats and caching static content.</p>
