<p>This blog is a follow up to <a href="https://www.annacunnane.co.uk/blog/My%20journey%20to%20become%20a%20developer">My Journey to Becoming a Developer. </a></p>
<p>In that post I described how Iâ€™d come to apply to the Founders and Coders bootcamp and make the switch to a new career.</p>
<p>Now as I start my first job in the tech industry Iâ€™m reflecting on my experiences on the course and my hopes for the future.</p>

<p>Some of the FAC22 members (and mentors) dressed for Halloween ðŸ‘»</p>
<h2> What did I learn in the past 12 weeks at FAC? </h2>
<p>Most obviously I learnt a lot about web development. The FAC curriculum teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, Next.js and React. I learnt how to build a web application from scratch which culminated in our final <a href="https://github.com/tech-for-better/solent-mind">Tech for Better</a> projects with real life stakeholders.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical skills I feel like I got a crash course in learning to work as a team. The way the FAC course is structured means that you are constantly learning from and teaching each other - alongside guidance from mentors from previous cohorts. There is an emphasis at FAC on leaving nobody behind which makes it a very supportive environment in which to learn.</p>
<p>I also improved my persistence and problem solving which I think are crucial skills for all developers. Learning how to learn - and Google things where you are unsure - is the only way to keep up with the ever changing technologies and frameworks in the industry.</p>
<h2> What were the challenges? </h2>
<p>As it was a bootcamp it was very intense and in the first half of the course we were learning a big new topic every week. I often felt like I was only grasping the fundamentals of the previous week by the middle of the next. I had, and still do have, a persistent feeling like I donâ€™t know enough. I also struggled with the feeling of frustration that you get from tricky bugs (read <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/the-origin-of-the-term-computer-bug">here</a> for why computer problems are called bugs ðŸ¦Ÿ).</p>
<h2> Whatâ€™s next? </h2>
<p>I've started an apprenticeship as a software developer at <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/">Common Knowledge</a> which Iâ€™m really excited about. Iâ€™ll also be back at FAC for a week in January to help mentor the next cohort. In the longer term Iâ€™d like to play an active role in the FAC community by helping out beginners as well as learning from my peers.</p>
<p>If you are looking to change careers into software development I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/">Founders and Coders</a>. If I can answer any questions about the process of applying for a software bootcamp please feel free to contact me using the form on my <a href="https://www.annacunnane.co.uk/about">about page</a> or email <a href="mailto:hello@annacunnane.co.uk">hello@annacunnane.co.uk</a>.</p>
